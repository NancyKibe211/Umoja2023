For more information please consult their page: https://openai.com/research/openai-baselines-ppo. Note that one could equally use other algorithms such as DQN and you encouraged to experiment with this, though it may involve changing other parts of the code such as evaluation/generate_rollout.py.\n","\n","Fundamentally, a PPO agent should implement a policy network and a value network. The policy network maps observations to a parametrisation of the policy that is used to select the next action, whereas the value network maps observations to a single number which is supposed to estimate the expected discounted future reward, and is used to stabilise the training. The model implemented here by default shares most of the parameters between these two networks, though you are encouraged to experiment with different model architectures.\n","\n","To understand the architecture of the model, examine the model class in training/PPO_models.py. By default it will use FactorisedPPOModel, which takes as input the cube and step count from the observation, and produces an encoding of the observation, which will be a fixed size vector of size given by the final entry of dense_layer_dims in the model_config (defined in training.configs.CUSTOM_MODEL_CONFIG). This encoding is projected to a single number for predicting the value. As for the policy, we take advantage of the factorised/conditional structure of the action space to produce first logits for the decision of which face to turn - the model's face_selection_model. Finally, we compute a conditional distribution by concatenating a sampled value of the selected face (encoded as a one-hot) to the encoding and projecting to give logits for the decision of how much to turn the face - the model's cube_movement_amount_selection_model. This model must be used in combination with the FactorisedActionDistribution.\n","\n","Note that if one instead flattens the action space this conditional structure will no longer be present and so one should use a different model like FlatPPOModel, and will not need to specify a custom action distribution (since by default PPO is expecting the model to output logits for a flat action space)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1cfe7e3d","metadata":{"id":"1cfe7e3d"},"source":["### Training your first model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2e888c0a","metadata":{"id":"2e888c0a"},"source":["The main training script will write a checkpoint (learned model weights and associated metadata) that you will later be able to use to evaluate training on unseen instances.\n","\n","This script can also be run from the command line; the following command will execute the same code as the python in the cell below:\n","\n","python training/example.py --step_limit 10 --reward_function_type sparse --num_scrambles_on_reset 2 --agent_name PPO --num_iterations 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"id":"1a95eed7","metadata":{"id":"1a95eed7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679156720758,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":539057,"user":{"displayName":"Ameck Dosseh","userId":"09603352587859208137"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"outputId":"c065fbf1-043e-4ed6-b964-5d26d57f4825"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["2023-03-18 16:16:26,687\tINFO worker.py:1529 -- Started a local Ray instance.
